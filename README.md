[Custom Artsey keyboard layout](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/gists/3949ff5171bbd401532929f5c0ae5fcd)

## Changes from the standard Artsey
- Base layer is the same as home keys for Colemak.
- Combo for Y is added; Combo for N is kept for compatibility.
- Combos for colon, semi-colon, question mark, and double quote are added.
- Symbols are re-arranged so that more common symbols for programming are under stronger fingers.
- Combos for many symbols are added to Symbols and Parentheticals layers, so that SHIFT is not needed for any symbol.
- Numbers and Custom layers are swapped, because numbers are more common, and it is easier to hold down pinky on the lower-row key and press the other keys on either row, than hold down pinky on the upper-row key and press the other keys on lower-row.
- Numbers are re-arranged similar to ten-key (1 thru 6).
- Functions and RGB layers are added.
